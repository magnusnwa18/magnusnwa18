### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mangus Nwaokeleme



### Background
I am an undergraduate student studying [Your Field of Study] at [University Name], and let me tell you, it's been a wild ride. My passion for data analysis began when I realized I could finally put my love for spreadsheets to good use. I have experience using data to drive decision-making, solve real-world problems, and make my professors think I'm smarter than I really am. I am proficient in [programming languages and tools], and I am always looking for new and exciting ways to put my skills to the test.
